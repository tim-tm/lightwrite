<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a really simple GUI-based text editor, which is based on the dramatic editor [ded](https://github.com/tsoding/ded), developed by [tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding), a twitch streamer known for recreational programming. As of right now, lightwrite is using his approach of handling file-content. Even though the code for managing files is not exactly the same, lightwrite will at least use the same datastructures.

* Written in plain C.
* lightweight (as the name implies)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/lightwrite.svg)](https://repology.org/project/lightwrite/versions)

If you only want to use lightwrite and not mess with it's source, go ahead an grab one of the [avalible releases](https://github.com/tim-tm/lightwrite/releases/latest) (preferably the latest).

prepare the release folder (VERSION stands for the version you've downloaded)
```sh
tar -xf lightwrite-VERSION.tar.gz && cd lightwrite-VERSION
```

building
```sh
./configure && make
```

installing
```sh
sudo make install
```

### Messing with the source

Here you can see how to setup this project locally.
Since this project is mainly developed in Linux, Windows build is not yet supported.

### Prerequisites

* git, autotools, make, gcc
* sdl2, sdl2_ttf

### Installation

clone the repo and move inside
```sh
git clone git@github.com:tim-tm/lightwrite.git && cd breakout
```

setting up the project
```sh
./autogen.sh
```

building
```sh
make -C build
```
or
```sh
cd build && make
```

Cleanup
```sh
./cleanup.sh
```

## Using

Lightwrite is **not** a vim-like editor (even though I personally prefer such editors).

|     **Keybind**    | **Action**                                  |
|:------------------:|---------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl+S             | Save the current buffer                     |
| Ctrl+Shift+f       | Open the filemanager                        |
| Ctrl+a             | Create a new file (only in the filemanager) |
| Up/Down/Left/Right | Navigating up/down/left/right               |
